## Short Description

The service we provide is that we privately track deliveries of cryptocurrency bounties earned in hackathons. The identity of the recipient and sender are scrutinised and both parties are given constant information about the whereabouts of the package.

Identification of a common pain-point in the process of onboarding developers into our industry seems to be the disconnection between earning a monetary reward from a Hackathon and not knowing when it will be received into our wallets. This coincides with a dangerous and increasingly vulnerable attack vector for our protocols, the advent of deep fakes for example urges the development and strengthening of our KYC procedures.

## How To Use

1) As a sponsor you must log into the platform through Sismo in order to prove your identity also. This is important because phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated.

2) Once wallet is also connected. Then its time to define the parameters to generate the peanut link. This includes the target address, the amount to transfer and which network.

3) Then you have the choice of either sending them an EVM based soul-based-token containing the link OR you can create a view-key for a secret NFT and send the view key to the user allowing them to claim.

4) User then signs in using sismo identity check by verifying their github for example. Then is able to either access the SBT or the view key (and the private metadata containing the link).

5) The user goes through the peanut claiming procedure and receives their money.

## FAQs

1) Why is this necessary?

Businesses manage many invoices, itâ€™s not unknown for bad actors to spoof invoices and will become a bigger exploit as we scale. Plus, people donâ€™t actually mind waiting one quarter for their earnings. They mind being in the dark about when they will receive them.

3) How is this different from sending a transaction to a wallet address and double checking its correct?

Firstly, there is an adaptable KYC procedure whereby by configuring sismo, sponsors can enforce the targeted recipient to have specific web2 account or other bespoke requirements. There is also the notable difference that it utilises a Peer-to-Peer network to broadcast the peanut link as opposed to a direct transaction. 

4) Why is it conducive that this solution involves so much privacy maintaining strategies?
   

3) What is the plan going forward?
