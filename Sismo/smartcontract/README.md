# Hardhat Project 

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample soul bound nft contract, a script that deploys and verify the contract on gnosis testnet and Base blockchain.

Try running the following tasks to deploy contract:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network> 

```

Try running the following tasks to verify contract:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contractAddress>

```

`#` Contract deployed address
